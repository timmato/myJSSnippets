# myJSSnippets
Collection of my vanilla javascript snippets that I can refer to.

Included so far:
checkbox_test.html - setting checkboxes and toggling disabled so the current checkbox cannot be unchecked by clicking it. 
  In a group of checkboxes where at least one checkbox has to be checked. Works with 2 or more checkboxes.
  Needs to be updated to work within a div in the case where theres more than one checkbox group
